Simple Perl script which, when called, shows the load average in titlebar of your terminal window.

Useful if you work on a few servers and you need to monitor realtime load average.

Save this as a script called tl, and copy it to your ~/bin directory.

When you’d like to have titlebar replaced with the name, load average, and current time of the machine you’re logged into, just run tl&

When your job is finished, just do: killall tl before logging out.

Or, if you want to automate this, you can try:

$echo 'killall tl > /dev/null 2>&1' >> ~/.bash_logout
